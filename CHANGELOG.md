# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [8.0.7]

### Fixed

- Swap: allow multi-witness swap transactions. Multi-input swaps spending UTXOs from
  different addresses of the same account require one payment-key witness per unique
  signing key; the previous `num_witnesses != 1` guard rejected these incorrectly.

### Changed

- Migrated Python linter from pylint to ruff.
- Fixed Apex device icon.

## [8.0.6]

### Fixed

- Fixed memory leak in transaction context cleanup path.

## [8.0.5]

### Changed

- Application name refined: displays as `Cardano ADA` in external contexts (Exchange,
  device manager) and as `Cardano` on-screen.

## [8.0.4]

### Added

- Unrestricted signing mode.
- Multisig DRep key support.
- Expert mode now shows network details (network ID and protocol magic).
